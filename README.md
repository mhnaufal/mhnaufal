Hi there 👋, my name is Naufal I am a college student majoring in Computer Science at Universitas Diponegoro. I love to learn about **Backend programming**, **DevOps**, and **Linux** related things and also now I'm learning about web development especially in backend side although I also do some frontend things. To get rid of my boredom I used to do competitive programming or CTF, but now I prefer to learn new programming languages and do some projects.
